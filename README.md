### Hi there 👋

My name is **Maximilian** (@betahuhn), I am a 22 year old **developer & designer** from Germany (:de:). I am currently helping build a new personal browser called [🏄‍♂️ Surf](https://deta.surf) at [Deta](https://github.com/deta).

I also love working on **open-source** projects and have developed multiple NPM libraries, GitHub Actions and other projects such as **[WebCrate](https://github.com/WebCrateApp/webcrate)**. I'm also an avid **photographer**, so check out the gallery on my website **[mxis.ch/gallery](https://mxis.ch/gallery)**. 

### ⚡ My Work

You can find all of my projects on **[GitHub](https://github.com/BetaHuhn?tab=repositories)** or on my website **[mxis.ch](https://mxis.ch)**. Also take a look at my **[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/betahuhn/)** profile for some of my designs. 

### 🔨 The tools I use
